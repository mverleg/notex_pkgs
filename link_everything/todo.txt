give every paragraph, section, equation etc an id based on it's hash, so it can be linked to but stays consistent precisely as long as the content is identical. Problem for duplicate elements though, but in that case just append a nr or whatever since people can just link to the first one. I was thinking of some nominal identifier, but it can't be position-based since everything'd break if a paragraph were added; hash is great (maybe remove insignificant whitespace)
